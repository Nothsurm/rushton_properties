# Full-Stack MERN Real Estate Project

## A fully functional project written in React for the front-end and Express/Node.js for the back-end

This project utilizes React components and states to fetch data from a database created in MongoDB. The database is manipulated by the user using CRUD operations. Sign-in and sign-up functionality may be achieved using Googles OAuth. The user may also do the following:

* Update or delete account information and own listings
* Filter information using React states to see the requested listing
* Sort the listings in ascending or descending order
